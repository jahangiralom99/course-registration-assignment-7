# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Add at least 3 Project features ?

 -1 Components : 
    *Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI.

 -2 PropsDrilling :
    *While prop drilling is a straightforward and often sufficient approach in small applications, it can become unwieldy as your project grows. 

 -3 Conditional Rendering :
    *Your components will often need to display different things depending on different conditions. In React, you can conditionally render JSX using JavaScript syntax like if statements, &&, and ? : operators.




## Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.?

 1-Component State :
    *React components have a built-in state object that can be used to manage local component-specific state. You can initialize and update this state using the useState hook for functional components,it used to number ,string ,array ,object 

 2- Props and Callbacks :
    *To manage state that needs to be shared between components, you can pass data down from parent components to child components as props.   

3- Sweet Alert-2 :
    *it used to if else statements, you can used to this future you can apply this return and show the display value.

4- UseeEffect :   
    *useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, DOM manipulation, subscriptions
